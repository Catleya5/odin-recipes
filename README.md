# odin-recipes

This first project will sharpen my first set of skills acquiared from The Odin Project,
I am going to build a basic recipe website.

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

It won't look very fancy but it's just momentary.

It's just to build my HTML chops, I will revisiting this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
